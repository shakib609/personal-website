        Hi, I am a Professional Software Engineer located in Berlin. I am currently pursuing my
        B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering. I love learning and working
        with new technologies. I have been working with Software Engineering and DevOps for
        more than five years now.

      <p>
        I was born in 1996 in Chittagong, Bangladesh. I first started coding
        when I was 15, I think. C was the first programming language I learned.
        Then after some time I started doing some competitive programming in
        various platforms like UVa, Hackerrank, CodeForces etc. I think this
        really helped me when I started to develop things, especially in the
        Backend.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that I tried Front-End Technologies(HTML, CSS, JS etc). But
        Backend Development was always appealing to me. So, I started learning
        some Backend Programming after a while. First, I tried Ruby on Rails for
        a while then after some time I tried Django and instantly I knew what my
        favorite framework is going to be. After sometime, I transitioned to DevOps role
        and working on this role ever since.
